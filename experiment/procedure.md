### Procedure

- Arrange the vertices of the graph in some order.

-  Choose the first vertex and color it with the first color

- Choose the next vertex and color it with the lowest numbered color that has not been colored on any vertices  adjacent to it. If all the adjacent vertices are colored with this color, assign a new color to it. Repeat this step until all the vertices are colored.
