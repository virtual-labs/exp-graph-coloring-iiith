      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "An undirected graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional ",
        "b": "bar graph is a chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars",
        "c": "A directed graph, also called a digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction",
        "d": "A weighted graph is a graph in which each branch is given a numerical weight"

      "question": "What is vertex coloring of a graph?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A condition where any two vertices having a common edge should not have same color",
        "b": " A condition where any two vertices having a common edge should always have same color",
        "c": "A condition where all vertices should have a different color",
        "d": "A condition where all vertices should have same color"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The condition for vertex coloring of a graph is that two vertices which share a common edge should not have the same color. If it uses k colors in the process then it is called k coloring of graph",
        "b": " ",
