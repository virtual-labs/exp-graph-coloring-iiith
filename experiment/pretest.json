        "a": "undirected graph",
        "b": "bar graph",
        "c": "directed graph",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "An undirected graph is graph, i.e., a set of objects (called vertices or nodes) that are connected together, where all the edges are bidirectional ",
        "b": "bar graph is a chart that presents categorical data with rectangular bars",
        "c": "A directed graph, also called a digraph, is a graph in which the edges have a direction",
        "d": "A weighted graph is a graph in which each branch is given a numerical weight"

      "question": "What is vertex coloring of a graph?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A condition where any two vertices having a common edge should not have same color",
        "b": " A condition where any two vertices having a common edge should always have same color",
        "c": "A condition where all vertices should have a different color",
        "d": "A condition where all vertices should have same color"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The condition for vertex coloring of a graph is that two vertices which share a common edge should not have the same color. If it uses k colors in the process then it is called k coloring of graph",

      "answers": {
        "a": " They must all have the same colour",
        "b": "They must all have different colours",

      "question": "A graph G has a chromatic number of 2. What can you conclude about G?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "G is a complete graph.",
        "b": " G is a bipartite graph.",
        "c": "G can only be coloured with exactly 2 colours.",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "",
        "b":  "(Since the chromatic number is 2, it can be properly coloured with just 2 colours, which is a characteristic of bipartite graphs)",

      "question": "A friend claims they coloured a graph with 10 vertices and only needed 1 colour.  Is this possible?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "No, this is not possible for any graph with more than 1 vertex",
        "b": "Yes, it's always possible to colour any graph with just 1 colour",
        "c": "It depends on the specific connections in the graph",
        "d": "Maybe, but it's very unlikely."
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Since vertices can be connected, you'll always need at least 2 colours to avoid colouring connected vertices the same",
